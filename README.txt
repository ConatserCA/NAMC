This data set I used in one of my past MATLAB Programming courses at the University of Texas at Dallas, however without any SQL use. This time around I figured it'd be interesting to incorporate it with SQL functions instead, and analyze it further with some Tableau visuals which is an area I haven't explored much of before.

Final commit with up-to-date .mdf & .ldf files should be up by 06/27/2022.
